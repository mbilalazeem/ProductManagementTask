# Avvoka Integration Project

This project provides solutions for integrating two systems, namely, a Document Automation and E-Signature System (System A) and a Document Management System (System B), using REST APIs and webhooks. The goal is to save documents generated on System A in System B.

Additionally, it incorporates a feature request to schedule automated reminder emails based on the value of the document generated on System A.

The solutions proposed in this project enhance document management, foster efficient communication, and improve overall user experience.
